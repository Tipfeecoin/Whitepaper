# Background
Bitcoin introduced the blockchain concept in 2008 and built the first peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transfer network. in 2014, Vitalik and his partners launched a
new Turing-complete blockchain network system, Ether, which has allowed more and more creative entrepreneurs to build many business applications in different 
fields on Ethereum. However, so far we haven't seen a social application with a good user experience being built on the blockchain network. Although there are some social
platforms with a large number of users but just like a blogging system and do not have a good user experience like twitter and Whatsapp. Starting September 7, 2021,
when El Salvador officially declares Bitcoin as legal tender in the country, we believe that cryptocurrencies will be more quickly integrated into every industry 
and enjoy the same importance as legal tender, driven by social communication applications. Ultimately, people will enjoy the new ways of social collaboration that
cryptocurrencies on blockchain web technology and blockchain social applications will bring. At the same time, we believe that cryptocurrency and blockchain 
technology should be widely integrated into society to provide services for social production, so that everyone can enjoy the quality services that blockchain
technology brings, especially in the social and media fields. We believe that a decentralized social application combining the features of Whatsapp, Twitter,
Instagram, Amazon and DoorDash should be built in the blockchain network to run continuously in the blockchain network and provide services to the societyã€‚
