*  ## Abstract
The application introduces a new decentralized social networking model designed to enable users to share exciting stories while being rewarded with tokens. This is where users are rewarded for sharing, commenting, and contributing to tags, special statuses, and achievements. The application architecture provides account rights management, multiple authentications, and file space management. It allows users to interact with ads in a smooth and friendly way, allowing more exciting and specialized content to help more people while allowing regular users to use it without paying.

*  ## Background
Blockchain technology originated with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, and since then entrepreneurs and developers have been working to promote the technology to support a wider range of applications on a single blockchain platform. It wasn't until 2014 that Ether was officially created, meaning a Turing-complete blockchain network system foundation could run a wider range of applications.


While some projects built on the blockchain are working to create applications belonging to their different domains to serve users, especially in specific scenarios of blockchain applications. For example, the Uniswap decentralized exchange and the Steem social media platform have become successful applications, with tens of thousands of active users every day.
However, as the development of existing blockchain and web3 application scenarios is still in its infancy, this leaves a very large space and possibility for the combination of the vast majority of the real economy and blockchain.

In some traditional web applications, good professional content creators earn very low income by sharing their videos and articles, which makes many good creators less motivated to create content because they can't earn more income by sharing their works. Based on this situation, we need to make changes to enable more talented and professional content creators to earn more money by creating content.
<br>
<br>
<br>

*  ## Permission-based user management
When a user logs into the application for the first time using a cryptocurrency wallet, the account is activated and the activated account belongs to the General user group. The normal user group does not have access to other account groups. If an account in the general user group wants to gain access to other user groups in the application, it can request to change the user group in the application to gain access to the application. Each user group account can only operate the corresponding account, but it is still possible to transfer funds between different user groups. For example, an account in the general user group cannot perform all operations of a seller's account, but it is possible to transfer funds between the general account and the seller's account.
<br>
<br>
<br>

*  ## Community Governance
When users encounter spam (e.g., large amounts of pornography, violent and gory information, uncomfortable information) while browsing, they can report it. Users will submit written messages for human review. Once the information is confirmed as spam, the registered content publisher will have their privileges reduced and receive a warning. When the number of notices reaches 5, the warned account will be deactivated and cannot be used typically. Deactivated accounts can still view messages on the app but can no longer post content, purchase products, or receive notifications.
<br>
<br>
*  ## Get rewarded for producing content
Every user can share beautiful things and items in the app through text, pictures and videos. When the content is successfully published, there will be a chance to get rewards from the audience, and there is no limit to the amount of the rewards. To motivate content creators to produce more great content, all rewards are fully owned by the author. The rewards do not depend on the number of reads, likes or retweets, which means that each content producer only has to serve his followers. All rewards are determined by readers and viewers.

<br>
<br>
<br>

*  ## Full Web Access Tag
Total Web Access Tag is an ad tagging module with time limits and content push. It is only available when a user posts content. When content is tagged as Full Web Access, that content is seen by everyone in the application.

The application generates 120 network-wide access tags every 6 hours and randomly assigns them to all standard users with different permissions.
Once a user has been given a network-wide access tag, they can add the title to their creative content or sell it to other users.
<br>
<br>
<br>


*  ## Achievement Titles

Users can add titles to the content they are interested in. For content creators, this is important. Each label represents an achievement earned by the content creator, and the title will display these achievements on the content creator's home page. Each tag rated by a user will show which user gifted each title. This way of giving tags to content creators will give a sense of accomplishment to both the creator of the content and the person who provided the label. Any user can share their earned titles and achievements on other networks or social applications
<br>
<br>
<br>
  
  
*  ## Earn money for sharing
When users share high-quality content from other creators in their own space, if someone views the original content from the shared connection and rewards the content, the shared users will receive 50% of each reward amount as a reward, and the other 50% will be allocated to the original content creators.

<br>
<br>
<br>

*  ## Publicly shared content
All shared content is public and cannot be hidden or deleted to ensure quality content is distributed to as many people as possible. Every piece of shared content represents the attitude and image of the person who shares it. This will have an impact on the popularity of the person sharing. If a user shares content that is spam, it may have a negative effect on the user's popularity in the application and may even be the subject of a report by other users. Conversely, users who share content that is helpful to others will increase their own popularity.
<br>
<br>
<br>


*  ## Add comments and earn rewards
Add comments and earn rewards.
The app introduces a comment reward mechanism to increase the activity and interactivity of the content while complementing the original author's range to make comments useful to more users. Through the reward mechanism, users will be encouraged to participate in commenting interactions actively and can earn rewards after posting comments under other people's content. 80% of the reward amount is given to the commenter, and the remaining 20% is given to the content's original author. The more rewards a comment has, the higher the ranking of that comment will be. This also means that observations with a high acceptance rate will have the opportunity to be seen by a more significant number of people.

*  ## Online Mall
The application allows any account to apply to become a takeaway merchant by providing a legal local business license. Merchants can add items to the app store and sell them to all users. The Online Store is intended primarily for local businesses and is designed to make it easy for users to find local items in the online mall quickly. This includes, but is not limited to, local department stores, movie tickets, tourist attraction tickets, restaurants, hostels, bars, and hair salons.

A unique mapping exists between each merchant account and its corresponding privilege level. An account cannot be used for personal account processing and operations once used for merchant account operations. This account mapping ensures the uniqueness and authenticity of merchant accounts. This means that each user's actual status and usage can be identified.
<br>
<br>
<br>




*  ## Transaction History
Each transaction record will be stored in a list of seller and buyer transaction records, and both parties will share a unique Transaction Record Value. The record value is automatically generated when a transaction is created. If one of the parties to a transaction disputes the transaction, the stored transaction history can be used for inquiries and follow-up． This applies to both online and offline transactions.
<br>
<br>
<br>



*  ## Privacy Protection
  After logging in, each account must be logged in through the user's encrypted wallet and has a separate file storage space, which can only be opened with the correct password. If, unfortunately, or under exceptional circumstances, the account is accessed by an illegal visitor, but the unlawful visitor does not have the password to access the storage space, the illegal visitor will also be unable to open the storage space.
<br>
<br>
<br>

*  ## File Storage
  
 To ensure that each account owns the content it posts, it requires a certain amount of storage space when posting content. The amount of storage space required will increase as more information is posted.
<br>
<br>
<br>
 
*  ## Local Advertising
Advertising types are divided into picture advertising and video advertising. The content objects of the advertisement include but are not limited to gift shops, flower shops, hotels, restaurants, gyms, bars, tourist attractions, clothing stores, food stores, pet stores, tool stores, and department stores.

Advertisements are presented as content in the application in a way that does not interfere with users and makes advertisements become part of the content. The advertisement's content will be automatically changed according to the local time, and different advertising content will be displayed in different periods. Users can purchase or add to the shopping cart directly below the advertising display.
<br>
<br>


Here is an application example using JavaScript code.
<br>
<br>
<pre>
<code>

       var h = new Date().getHours();
       var t = "";
       var n = "";
       if(h >= 7 && h <= 13){
       t = "Ads1";  
　　　  }else if(h >= 14 && h <= 20){
       t = "Ads2";
　　　　}
       else if(h >= 21 || h <= 6){
       t = "Ads3";
  　　 }
　     document.getElementById('time_ads').innerHTML = t;

</code>
</pre>




*  ## Advertising Revenue Distribution
The program calculates and deposits the amount paid by advertisers into the distribution account; 10% will be deposited into the charitable fund, 55% will be distributed to all $TPF holders, and 35% will be deposited into the operating fund. 

The program reads the addresses of all $TPF holders from the Ethernet and within the application, respectively, and reorders them from largest to smallest based on the number of $TPF held. The amount due to each $TPF holder is calculated. Once the calculation is complete, the program will transfer the proceeds from the allocated account to the accounts of all $TPF holders individually. If the holder is already logged into the program, the transfer will go directly to the holder's in-app account with an alert. Otherwise, it will go to the holder's wallet address.

*  ## Helping underprivileged children and people with depression

$TPF was created with the primary purpose of building an economic community and application to help each other. We not only want to achieve our business goals but also to help others. $TPF will help underprivileged children and depressed people, and we actively encourage $TPF holders to help them. When they are in danger and desperate, they can get help from us.
According to UNICEF, about one billion children worldwide live in multidimensional poverty. This means they lack necessities such as nutrition or clean water, and about 100 million children live in multidimensional poverty.
<br>

Depression is a common disorder worldwide, with an estimated 5% of adults worldwide suffering from depression. More women than men are affected by depression, and many depressions lead to suicide.
According to the World Health Organization, depression affects about 3.8% of the global population, including 5.0% of adults and 5.7% of adults over 60. Approximately 280 million people worldwide suffer from depression. Moderate or severe depression can become a serious health condition.
