*  ## Abstract
The application introduces a new decentralized social networking application model designed to enable users to share interesting stories while being rewarded with tokens. This is where users are rewarded for participating in sharing, commenting and contributing to tags as well as special status and achievements. The application architecture provides account rights management, multiple authentication, and file space management. It allows users to interact with ads in a smooth and friendly way, allowing more interesting and specialized content to help more people, while allowing regular users to use it without paying for it.

*  ## Background
Blockchain technology originated with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, and since then entrepreneurs and developers have been working to promote the technology to support a wider range of applications on a single blockchain platform. It wasn't until 2014 that Ether was officially created, meaning a Turing-complete blockchain network system foundation could run a wider range of applications.


While some projects built on the blockchain are working to create applications belonging to their different domains to serve users, especially in specific scenarios of blockchain applications. For example, the Uniswap decentralized exchange and the Steem social media platform have become successful applications, with tens of thousands of active users every day.
However, as the development of existing blockchain and web3 application scenarios is still in its infancy, this leaves a very large space and possibility for the combination of the vast majority of the real economy and blockchain.

In some traditional web applications, good professional content creators earn very low income by sharing their videos and articles, which makes many good creators less motivated to create content because they can't earn more income by sharing their works. Based on this situation, we need to make changes to enable more talented and professional content creators to earn more money by creating content.

*  ## Permission-based user management
When a user logs into the application for the first time using a cryptocurrency wallet, the account is activated and the activated account belongs to the General user group. The normal user group does not have access to other account groups. If an account in the general user group wants to gain access to other user groups in the application, it can request to change the user group in the application to gain access to the application. Each user group account can only operate the corresponding account, but it is still possible to transfer funds between different user groups. For example, an account in the general user group cannot perform all operations of a seller's account, but it is possible to transfer funds between the general account and the seller's account.

*  ## Community Governance
Wihle users encounter spam (e.g., large amounts of pornography, violent and gory information, uncomfortable information) while browsing, they can report it. Reported messages will be submitted to human review. Once the information is confirmed as spam, the reported content publisher will have their privileges reduced and receive a warning. When the number of warnings reaches 5, the warned account will be deactivated and cannot be used normally. Deactivated accounts can still view messages on the app, but can no longer post any content, purchase products, or receive messages.

*  ## Get rewarded for producing content
Every user can share beautiful things and items in the app through text, pictures and videos. When the content is successfully published, there will be a chance to get rewards from the audience, and there is no limit to the amount of the rewards. To motivate content creators to produce more great content, all rewards are fully owned by the author. The rewards do not depend on the number of reads, likes or retweets, which means that each content producer only has to serve his followers. All rewards are determined by readers and viewers.

*  ## Full Web Access Tag
Full Web Access Tag is an ad tagging module with time limits and content push. It is only available when a user posts content.  When content is tagged as Full Web Access, that content is seen by everyone in the application.

The application generates 120 network-wide access tags every 6 hours and randomly assigns them to all normal users with different permissions.
Once a user has been given a network-wide access tag, they can add the tag to their own creative content or sell it to other users.


*  ## Achievement Tags

Any user can add tags to content that they are interested in. For content creators, this is important. Each tag represents an achievement that has been earned by the content creator, and these achievements will be displayed on the home page of the content creator. Each hashtag earned by a user will show the source and display the username of the giver. This will give a sense of accomplishment to both the creator of the content and the person who gave the tag. Any user will be able to share the tags and achievements they have earned on other networks or social applications.
  
  
*  ## Earn money for sharing
When a user shares quality content from other creators to their own space. If a person views the original content from the shared connection and rewards the content, the active user will receive 50% of the reward amount and the other 50% is distributed to the original content author.

*  ## Publicly shared content
All shared content is public and cannot be hidden or deleted to ensure that quality content is distributed to as many people as possible. Every piece of content that is shared is a representation of the attitude and image of the person who shares it. This will have an impact on the popularity of the person sharing. If a user shares content that is spam, it may have a negative impact on the user's popularity in the application and may even be the subject of a report by other users. Conversely, users who share content that is helpful to others will increase their own popularity.

*  ## Add comments and earn rewards
Add comments and earn rewards
The app introduces a comment reward mechanism to increase the activity and interactivity of the content, while complementing the original author's content, in order to make comments useful to more users. Through the reward mechanism, users will be encouraged to actively participate in commenting interactions and will have the opportunity to earn rewards after posting comments under other people's content. 80% of the reward amount is given to the commenter, and the remaining 20% is given to the original author of the content. The more rewards a comment has, the higher the ranking of that comment will be. This also means that comments with a high rate of acceptance will have the opportunity to be seen by a larger number of people.

*  ## Online Mall
The application allows any account to apply to become a takeaway merchant by providing a legal local business license. Merchants can add items to the app store and sell them to all users. The Online Store is intended primarily for local businesses and is designed to make it easy for users to quickly find local items in the online mall. This includes, but is not limited to, local department stores, movie tickets, tourist attraction tickets, restaurants, hostels, bars, and hair salons.

There is a unique mapping between each merchant account and its corresponding privilege level. An account cannot be used for personal account processing and operations once it has been used for merchant account operations. This account mapping ensures the uniqueness and authenticity of merchant accounts. This means that the true status and usage of each user can be identified .


*  ## Transaction History
Each transaction record will be stored in a list of seller and buyer transaction records, and both parties will share a unique Transaction Record Value. The record value is automatically generated when a transaction is created. In the event that one of the parties to a transaction disputes the transaction, the stored transaction history can be used for inquiries and follow-up．this applies to both online and offline transactions.

*  ## Privacy Protection
  A login via the user's encrypted wallet is required for each account. Each user has a separate storage space that can only be opened with the correct password. If, unfortunately or in exceptional cases, the account is illegally accessed, but the illegal visitor does not have the password to access the storage space, then the person who was illegally accessed will not be able to open the storage space either.

*  ## File Storage
  
 In order to ensure that each account owns the content it posts, each account requires a certain amount of storage space when posting content. The amount of storage space required will increase as more information is posted.
 
*  ## Local Advertising
The Advertising types are divided into picture ads and video ads, and the content objects of ads include but are not limited to gift stores, flower stores, hotels, restaurants, gyms, bars, tourist attractions, clothing stores, food stores, pet stores, tool stores, and department stores. 

The Advertising are presented as content within the app in a way that does not disturb the user and makes the ads part of the content. Ads automatically switch to different content based on the local time. Different ads will be displayed to users at different times to achieve real-time user selectable demand. Users can purchase or add to the shopping cart directly below the ad display.

Here is an application example using JavaScript code.
<pre>
<code>

var h = new Date().getHours();
var t = "";
var n = "";
if(h >= 7 && h <= 13){
        t = "Ads1";  
}else if(h >= 14 && h <= 20){
        t = "Ads2";
}
  else if(h >= 21 || h <= 6){
        t = "Ads3";
  }
document.getElementById('time_ads').innerHTML = t;


</code>
</pre>



*  ## Advertising Revenue Distribution
55% of each ad revenue belongs to all $TPF holders, 35% will go to the app's operating fund, and 10% will go to support charitable causes. The charitable fund is primarily responsible for achieving the social responsibility goals set by our executives. The use of the charitable fund is determined by a vote of all $TPF holders.

The program calculates and deposits the amount paid by advertisers into the distribution account, 10% will be deposited into the charitable fund, 55% will be distributed to all $TPF holders, and 35% will be deposited into the operating fund. The program reads the addresses of all $TPF holders from the Ethernet and within the application, respectively, and reorders them from largest to smallest based on the number of $TPF held. The amount due to each $TPF holder is calculated. Once the calculation is complete, the program will transfer the proceeds from the allocated account to the accounts of all $TPF holders one by one. If the holder is already logged into the program, the transfer will go directly to the holder's in-app account with an alert, otherwise it will go to the holder's wallet address.

*  ## Helping underprivileged children and people with depression

$TPF was created with the main purpose of building an economic community and application to help each other. We not only want to achieve our business goals, but also to help others. $TPF will help underprivileged children and depressed people, and we actively encourage $TPF holders to help them. When they are in danger and desperate, they can get help from us.
According to UNICEF, about one billion children worldwide live in multidimensional poverty. This means they lack basic necessities such as nutrition or clean water, and about 100 million children live in multidimensional poverty.
. Depression
Depression is a common disorder in the world, with an estimated 5% of adults worldwide suffering from depression. More women than men are affected by depression, and many depressions lead to suicide.
According to the World Health Organization, depression affects about 3.8% of the global population, including 5.0% of adults and 5.7% of adults over the age of 60. Approximately 280 million people worldwide suffer from depression. Moderate or severe depression can become a serious health condition.
