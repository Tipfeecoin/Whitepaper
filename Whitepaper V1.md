## Abstract
Tipfee introduces a social application that can wrap cryptocurrencies as gifts, aiming to provide users with a good user experience while being more social with
value attributes. The application consists of instant messaging and social media and an online shopping mall. Instant messaging can handle thousands of incoming 
and outgoing chat messages simultaneously. Social activity allows users to select gift effects to give to friends in the gift shop. Users post content in the
media space and have the opportunity to earn money by posting content. The final form of the application is a social application that is available to all for
free.

Conclusion


# Background
Bitcoin introduced the blockchain concept in 2008 and built the first peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transfer network. in 2014, Vitalik and his partners launched a
new Turing-complete blockchain network system, Ether, which has allowed more and more creative entrepreneurs to build many business applications in different 
fields on Ethereum. However, so far we haven't seen a social application with a good user experience being built on the blockchain network. Although there are some social
platforms with a large number of users but just like a blogging system and do not have a good user experience like twitter and Whatsapp. Starting September 7, 2021,
when El Salvador officially declares Bitcoin as legal tender in the country, we believe that cryptocurrencies will be more quickly integrated into every industry 
and enjoy the same importance as legal tender, driven by social communication applications. Ultimately, people will enjoy the new ways of social collaboration that
cryptocurrencies on blockchain web technology and blockchain social applications will bring. At the same time, we believe that cryptocurrency and blockchain 
technology should be widely integrated into society to provide services for social production, so that everyone can enjoy the quality services that blockchain
technology brings, especially in the social and media fields. We believe that a decentralized social application combining the features of Whatsapp, Twitter,
Instagram, Amazon and DoorDash should be built in the blockchain network to run continuously in the blockchain network and provide services to the societyã€‚

# Gift Wrap
Gift Wrap
Gift wrapping is a $TPF packaging effect consisting of visual effects and music. The core of gift wrap is a gift package for different countries and usage scenarios
for different holidays and regions. Gift wrapping includes but is not limited to: birthday gifts, holiday gifts, funny gifts, couple gifts, greeting gifts and 
visiting gifts. All of these gifts can be purchased through the gift wrap store prior to use.

Once the user has purchased the package, they can freely combine the effects and music in the chat and send it to their friends according to their needs.

# Gift Wrap Mall
Once the gift wrap effects are uploaded to the application, the author can freely price and sell them in the Gift Wrap Mall, where users can purchase gift wrap 
effects and music on demand.
To make it easier for users to purchase gift packs, they will be categorized according to usage scenarios. In addition, in order to facilitate users to find the 
precise gift package they want, users can enter keywords in the search box to search.

# Gift Wrap Creators
The visual effects and music of the Gift Pack are created by any effect creator and music producer who holds $TPF. 95% of the Gift Pack proceeds go to the author 
and the remaining 5% will be distributed to all $TPF holders. Each time a Gift Pack is sold, 95% of the funds from the sale will be transferred directly to the 
user's account on the app, and the remaining 5% will be transferred to the allocation pool. Funds in the distribution pool will be allocated to $TPF holders based
on the percentage of holdings.

  Users can search for users by entering their wallet address or ENS domain name, and if the user exists, they can add the searched user as a friend.

Two users who exist simultaneously with the contact list can interact in real time by sending and receiving messages including emoticons, pictures, audio, video, documents and zip files. Live online voice calls and video calls are also supported. Each user can receive thousands of messages simultaneously. When a user sends a message, it is saved to their own storage after 3 minutes and can be undone within 3 minutes if they send a message by mistake or by mistake.
