## Background
Bitcoin introduced the blockchain concept in 2008 and built the first peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transfer network. in 2014, Vitalik and his partners launched a
new Turing-complete blockchain network system, Ethereum, which has allowed more and more creative entrepreneurs to build many business applications in different 
fields on Ethereum. However, so far we haven't seen a social application with a good user experience being built on the blockchain network. Although there are some social
platforms with a large number of users but just like a blogging system and do not have a good user experience like twitter and Whatsapp. Starting September 7, 2021,
when El Salvador officially declares Bitcoin as legal tender in the country, we believe that cryptocurrencies will be more quickly integrated into every industry 
and enjoy the same importance as legal tender, driven by social communication applications. Ultimately, people will enjoy the new ways of social collaboration that
cryptocurrencies on blockchain web technology and blockchain social applications will bring. At the same time, we believe that cryptocurrency and blockchain 
technology should be widely integrated into society to provide services for social production, so that everyone can enjoy the quality services that blockchain
technology brings, especially in the social and media fields. We believe that a decentralized social application combining the features of Whatsapp, Twitter,
Instagram, Amazon and DoorDash should be built in the blockchain network to run continuously in the blockchain network and provide services to the societyã€‚

## About Tipfee token
Tipfee, a peer-to-peer digital gift
Tipfee token is an ERC20 token published on the ethereum network. It was minted by creator tipfeecoin.eth on Sep-24-2022 01:33:23 PM +UTC and published on the 
Ethernet network under the symbol TPF. we define Tipfee as a peer-to-peer digital gift.

## Gift Wrap
Gift Wrap
Gift wrapping is a $TPF packaging effect consisting of visual effects and music. The core of gift wrap is a gift package for different countries and usage scenarios
for different holidays and regions. Gift wrapping includes but is not limited to: birthday gifts, holiday gifts, funny gifts, couple gifts, greeting gifts and 
visiting gifts. All of these gifts can be purchased through the gift wrap store prior to use.

Once the user has purchased the package, they can freely combine the effects and music in the chat and send it to their friends according to their needs.

## Gift Wrap Mall
Once the gift wrap effects are uploaded to the application, the author can freely price and sell them in the Gift Wrap Mall, where users can purchase gift wrap 
effects and music on demand.
To make it easier for users to purchase gift packs, they will be categorized according to usage scenarios. In addition, in order to facilitate users to find the 
precise gift package they want, users can enter keywords in the search box to search.

## Gift Wrap Creators
The visual effects and music of the Gift Pack are created by any effect creator and music producer who holds $TPF. 95% of the Gift Pack proceeds go to the author 
and the remaining 5% will be distributed to all $TPF holders. Each time a Gift Pack is sold, 95% of the funds from the sale will be transferred directly to the 
user's account on the app, and the remaining 5% will be transferred to the allocation pool. Funds in the distribution pool will be allocated to $TPF holders based
on the percentage of holdings.


## Social media applications
*  ## Contracts
  Users can search for users by entering their wallet address or ENS domain name, and if the user exists, they can add the searched user as a friend. When one party sends a friend request, the other party will receive a verification message, and once the message is verified, it will be considered as an agreement to be added as a friend, and both the sender of the message and the verified party will appear in both contact lists.
  
  
*  ## Message Processing 
Two users who exist simultaneously with the contact list can interact in real time by sending and receiving messages including emoticons, pictures, audio, video, documents and zip files. Live online voice calls and video calls are also supported. Each user can receive thousands of messages simultaneously. When a user sends a message, it is saved to their own storage after 3 minutes and can be undone within 3 minutes if they send a message by mistake or by mistake. To protect the privacy of the user's chat, all text messages are stored in the user's private memory.


*  ## Transfers and Gift Giving with No Fees In chat 
Transfers and gift packages can be done between any two different users in the chat without any fees.
*  ## Online video calls and voice calls
Online video calls and voice calls can be made between any two different users for any duration without network limitations. In general, the call quality depends on the quality of the network signal in the user's area.


*  ## Personal Center
Users can set and edit personalized display content through the Personal Center. This includes but is not limited to privacy settings, general settings, gift packs, language settings, version updates, and help center.Privacy Settings.


*  ## Privacy Setting
In the privacy settings, users can edit and change their storage space password by themselves.

*  ## Language setting
  In order to meet the needs of users in different countries and regions, the application allows users to choose their own language to use.

*  ## Font size setting
  
 Considering different people's eye and screen habits, the application will provide different application font sizes for users to choose.
 
*  ## Storage Space
Users can purchase additional storage space according to their storage space usage needs.


*  ## Articles 
Articles are mainly for writers and media in professional fields to share knowledge and publish news, students and researchers to publish research papers, and writers and web fiction creators to publish articles. In addition to text, images and videos can be inserted into the body of the article, and there is no time limit for videos.

*  ## Short Essays

Each short article is between 1 and 500 words and can be accompanied by 1-9 images or a video. Users can choose to post text only, text with images and text with video. 

*  ## All content creator earnings
Anyone can post text, images and videos on the program to earn revenue. All creative revenue is based on viewers or readers' rewards. To motivate content creators to create works that viewers like. There is no limit to the amount of reward that viewers can give to support the creators. It does not depend on the number of views, likes and comments. Even if a video has only 1 view, it has the chance to be rewarded by the viewers and the creator is still entitled to the revenue. 100% of the reward revenue goes to the creator of the content.

*  ## Local Advertising

Ad types are divided into picture ads and video ads, and the content objects of ads include but are not limited to gift stores, flower stores, hotels, restaurants, gyms, bars, tourist attractions, clothing stores, food stores, pet stores, tool stores, and department stores. 

The Advertising are presented as content within the app in a way that does not disturb the user and makes the ads part of the content. Ads automatically switch to different content based on the local time. Different ads will be displayed to users at different times to achieve real-time user selectable demand. Users can purchase or add to the shopping cart directly below the ad display.

*  ## Brand Advertising
Brand Advertising are displayed on the app differently than local Advertising in that the branding is randomly displayed across all the content the user views, but does not change the content of the ad over time. Everyone will see the same branded ad, but it will be displayed in a different location.

*  ## Advertising Revenue Distribution

55% of each advertising revenue belongs to all $TPF holders, 35% goes to the app's operating fund, and 10% goes to support charitable causes.

The charitable fund is primarily responsible for achieving the social responsibility goals set by our executives. The use of the charitable fund is determined by a vote of all $TPF holders.

After an advertiser pays, the program reads the amount of the ad from the advertiser's paid funds account and calculates the portion that belongs to the $TPFholder.
All proceeds from the ad are credited to a wallet address. Depending on the percentage, 10% will be deposited into the charity fund, 55% into the dividend fund and 35% into the operating fund. The program reads all addresses holding $TPF from the Ethernet and within the application, respectively, and reorders them according to the number of $TPF held, from largest to smallest. The program will call the advertised fund distribution wallet address and calculate the amount due to each $TPF holder.
Once the calculation is complete, the program will transfer the proceeds from the allocation address to the wallet addresses of all $TPF holders one by one. If the holder is already logged in the program, the transfer will be made directly to the holder's in-app account with an alert, otherwise the transfer will be made to the holder's wallet address.

 ## Data Storage

Each data storage in the application will be stored on a decentralized network with distributed storage technology. Text, image and video files are hashed to prevent data tampering. The original data is sent to the ipfs network along with the hash value, and the ipfs network returns the storage address.


 ## Account and Privacy
To protect user privacy, all users will be logged into the Tipfee application through their own cryptocurrency wallet. When a user logs out of the application, all data being updated, except for temporary chat logs, will not be received and disconnected from the user in the application interface, and all content will be reloaded when the user logs back in.

 ## Client Information Protection
As with all centralized switching applications, when a user's end device connects to the application, the application processes the appropriate information based on the IP of the end device. The difference is that Tipfee's application compiles a random hash of the information it obtains after obtaining the IP of the end device. By default, the IP information of each end device will be randomly compiled 32 times per second. The number of random compilation operations per second will be gradually increased if there is enough computational space. This is to ensure that the information of each end device is not easily decompiled.

 ## Storage Space
Each account will have its own unique data storage space for text, images, videos and documents as well as compressed files. No one can access it except the user himself. The user owns the storage space and the user needs to set a key to access it. All stored data cannot be modified or deleted.

 ## TPF Economic Model

Total number of tokens 12,000,000,000,000

Uniswap injected 81.7%

Team hold 10.3%

Community promotion 8%

 ## Dual signatures for online meetings
 
To ensure the security and confidentiality of each company or group conducting a meeting, the system defines and stores a double signature. The first signature is a unique password customized within the company or group, and the custom password for each online meeting is randomly generated by the meeting host and distributed to each online meeting participant. The second signature is a unique handwritten signature on an electronic device that corresponds to the individual in the corporate list. Each conference participant must pass the double signature to access the conference network. This scenario is based on two considerations. In the first case, as proposed above, when a portion of the meeting participants are unable to turn on the camera, all meeting participants are unable to confirm whether a false participant or a participant is illegally hijacked behind a camera that is turned off. In the second case, when the camera can work properly, if someone uses AI technology or 3D modeling rendering coupled with motion capture to synthesize a fake meeting participant, this will become a very big privacy security risk. Because the second case is easy to implement. Therefore, the program will require a double signature for each conference participant, and access to the conference will be granted when the double signature is passed, otherwise it will be denied.

 ## Support thousands of people online meeting at the same time
Any user with privileges can initiate video and voice conferences. All conference participants are connected to the conference network through a parallel network, and each conference participant will be in a position to receive and send information to the conference. In video conferencing, considering that different web conference participants may use different physical end devices such as phones, PCs, pads and other visual devices, and that different conference participants have different levels of network fluency. The application will use two different statuses to mark the availability of the camera and display it in the network of the corresponding meeting participant based on the video availability of the device and the network status.
If a conference participant's camera is shown as unavailable, it will be switched to voice when speaking.

 ## Social Responsibility Goals is Helping underprivileged children and depressed people
$TPF was created with the main purpose of building an economical community and application to help each other. We not only want to achieve our business goals, but also to help others. $TPF will help underprivileged children and depressed people, and we actively encourage $TPF holders to help them. They can get help from us when they are in danger and desperate.
About 1 billion children worldwide are living in multidimensional poverty, according to UNICEF. This means they lack basic necessities such as nutrition or clean water, and about 100 million more children are living in multidimensional poverty. 
. Depression
Depression is a common disorder worldwide, with an estimated 5% of adults suffering from depression, globally. More women than men are affected by depression, and many depressions lead to suicide.
According to the World Health Organization, depression affects approximately 3.8% of the global population, including 5.0% of adults and 5.7% of adults over the age of 60. About 280 million people worldwide suffer from depression. Moderate or severe depression can become a serious health condition.

 ## Affirmation

To ensure uniformity of white paper content and applications, we have implemented a white paper updateability policy. When a white paper is updated, the updated content will not overwrite the original content, but will be linked in a way that distinguishes the different versions. This also helps $TPF holders and users to know and understand the status of the project. The application will be developed strictly in accordance with the white paper, but if the application goes beyond the scope of the white paper, it will be updated in the V2 version of the white paper, as the white paper is not yet complete.

 ## Conclusion
Tipfeecoin will be a blockchain social application that is free for all to try without registration, and we believe that it will contribute to society through a more approachable and enjoyable social and media experience. At the same time, content creators will be able to earn money directly from their creations. $TPF Holders.
